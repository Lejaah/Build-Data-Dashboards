# Build-Data-Dashboards

## Project Description
In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

There are 3 different data sets you can choose from.

Flight Delays and Cancellations
US Census Demographic Data
Youtube Data from the US

## Flight Delays and Cancellations
You are required to create three visualizations. Some questions you may attempt to answer include those pertaining to the following areas:

1. Which airlines or airports have the worst delays?
2. What causes delays?
3. You can also come up with your own question!
